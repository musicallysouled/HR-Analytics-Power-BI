This is en end-to-end HR analytic project. Here are the specific steps that are taken in the project:
  1.Problem definition: To identify trends in employee attrition.
  2.Data gathering: The next step is to gather the data that you need to solve the problem. In this case, the data is provided by Codebasics.
  3.Data cleaning and preparation: Once the data is gathered, it needs to be cleaned and prepared. This involves removing any errors or inconsistencies in the data, and transforming it into a format that is easy to analyze.
  4.Data analysis: The next step is to analyze the data and identify trends. In this case, the analysis reveals that the employee attendance rate is higher for employees on Mondays. The analysis also reveals that employees are more likely to work from home on Fridays.
  5.Dashboard creation: The final step is to create dashboards to communicate the insights that you have found to stakeholders. The dashboards that are created in this project show the employee attendance rate, work from home rate, and sick leave rate rate over time.

Here are some additional steps that can be taken to analyze employee attendance data:
  1.Identify the top reasons for absence: This will help you to understand what is causing employees to miss work.
  2.Track trends in absences over time: This will help you to identify any patterns in absences, such as seasonal trends or spikes in absences around certain events.
