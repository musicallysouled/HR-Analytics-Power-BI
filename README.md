# HR-Analytics-Power-BI
This is en end-to-end HR analytic project. Here are the specific steps that are taken in the project:
  1.Problem definition: The first step is to define the problem that you want to solve. In this case, the problem is to identify trends in employee attrition.
  2.Data gathering: The next step is to gather the data that you need to solve the problem. In this case, the data is provided by Codebasics.
  3.Data cleaning and preparation: Once the data is gathered, it needs to be cleaned and prepared. This involves removing any errors or inconsistencies in the data, and transforming it into a format that is easy to analyze.
  4.Data analysis: The next step is to analyze the data and identify trends. In this case, the analysis reveals that the employee attrition rate is higher for employees in the sales department than in other departments. The analysis also reveals that employees with lower salaries are more likely to leave the company than employees with higher salaries.
  5.Dashboard creation: The final step is to create dashboards to communicate the insights that you have found to stakeholders. The dashboards that are created in this project show the employee attrition rate, average tenure, and departmental attrition rate over time. The dashboards also show the relationship between salary, performance rating, and attrition rate.
